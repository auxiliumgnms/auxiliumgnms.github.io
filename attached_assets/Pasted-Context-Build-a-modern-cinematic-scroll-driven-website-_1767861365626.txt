Context

Build a modern, cinematic, scroll-driven website for a school-hosted TEDx event.
The site should feel minimal, intellectual, and Apple-like, not flashy or marketing-heavy.

Event details:

Event type: TEDx (school hosted)

Theme: Compass Within

Subtitle: Finding direction in a world full of signals

Date: 5 February

Speakers: 10 total (6 students, 4 external – externals may be placeholders)

Primary audience: students

Secondary audience: teachers, judges, speakers

1. TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Use the following stack unless technically impossible:

Framework: React (preferably with Vite or Next.js)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animation: GSAP + ScrollTrigger

3D: Three.js (or React Three Fiber if appropriate)

Deployment: Must run locally and be deployable from Replit

Performance: Graceful fallback for low-end devices

Do NOT use WordPress, heavy UI libraries, or autoplay audio.

2. CORE DESIGN CONCEPT

The website is a scroll-narrative experience, similar to Apple product pages.

Central Visual Element

A 3D red glass “X”

Represents a compass / internal direction

Appears throughout the scroll experience

Visual Style

Black or very dark background

White typography

Deep TED-red accent

Large headings, minimal text

Generous whitespace

Subtle lighting and reflections

3. PAGE STRUCTURE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Pages

Home (main scroll experience)

Speakers

Attend

About TEDx

Keep navigation minimal (max 4 links).

4. HOME PAGE — SCROLL FLOW LOGIC

Implement the homepage as one continuous scroll-controlled narrative.

SECTION 1 — Hero (0–10%)

Purpose: Legitimacy + presence

Full viewport

Centered 3D X

Text:

“TEDx[SchoolName]”

“Compass Within”

“Ideas worth spreading”

No navigation visible yet

Animation:

X fades in slowly

No rotation yet

SECTION 2 — Theme Orientation (10–25%)

Purpose: Explain theme emotionally, not literally

X subtly tilts as if “searching”

Light moves across glass material

Text fades in/out:

“Finding direction in a world full of signals”

SECTION 3 — Meaning (25–40%)

Purpose: Reflection

Scroll speed feels slower

X rotates slightly and stabilizes

Copy example:

“Direction isn’t found. It’s formed.”

SECTION 4 — Speakers Preview (40–55%)

Purpose: Social proof

X moves slightly to the side

Speaker cards slide in

Show 6 speakers max

Button: “View all speakers”

Speaker cards:

Photo placeholder

Name

Short topic line

SECTION 5 — Event Details (55–70%)

Purpose: Clarity

Reduce motion

Text-focused section

Display clearly:

Date: 5 February

Speakers: 10

Format: Student-led TEDx event

SECTION 6 — Call to Action (70–90%)

Purpose: Decision

X is calm, centered

Primary CTA button:

“Attend”

Secondary CTA:

“Learn more”

SECTION 7 — Exit / Closure (90–100%)

Purpose: Confidence

X settles into final position

Glow slightly increases

No further motion

5. 3D X REQUIREMENTS

Red glass / acrylic material

Slight transparency

Subtle internal glow

No constant spinning

All motion tied to scroll position

If real-time 3D is too heavy:

Fallback to pre-rendered video or static image

6. MOBILE & PERFORMANCE RULES

Detect device capability

On mobile:

Replace live 3D with static image or short looping video

Keep text and layout identical

Maintain 60fps on desktop where possible

Lazy-load assets

7. SPEAKERS PAGE

Simple grid layout

Click opens modal or detail page

No heavy animations

Focus on clarity and credibility

8. ATTEND PAGE

Clear registration CTA

Placeholder button for external form (Google Form / Eventbrite)

Brief rules or eligibility section

9. ABOUT TEDx PAGE

Explain:

What TEDx is

Difference between TED and TEDx

Student-led nature of the event

Keep tone calm and factual

10. CODE QUALITY EXPECTATIONS

Clean, modular components

Comments explaining scroll logic

Separate animation logic from layout

Reusable components where possible

11. IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

No autoplay audio

No flashy transitions

No gimmicky effects

Motion must always serve meaning

Site must feel professional, calm, and intentional

GOAL

The final website should feel like:

A guided journey through an idea, not a typical event website.

Build the foundation first, then progressively enhance animations and visuals.
